              <p>
                EduResources is a comprehensive educational platform created by students, for students. We understand 
                the challenges of academic life – the late-night study sessions, the scramble to find reliable resources, 
                and the stress of exam preparation. That's why we built EduResources: to be the one-stop destination 
                for all your study material needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our platform brings together a vast collection of study notes, assignments, and previous year question 
                papers, all organized by department, year, semester, and subject. Whether you're preparing for your 
                first semester exams or tackling final year projects, EduResources has you covered.

              <p>
                Our mission is simple yet powerful: to democratize access to educational resources. We believe that 
                every student deserves access to quality study materials, regardless of their background or circumstances. 
                By curating and organizing educational content, we aim to level the playing field and help students 
                achieve their full academic potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're committed to maintaining a platform that is user-friendly, regularly updated, and completely 
                focused on the needs of students. Our goal is to reduce the time you spend searching for resources 
                and maximize the time you spend actually learning.
